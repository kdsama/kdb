Distributed Key-Value Store (Master's Project)


# Distributed Key-Value Store

<!--- ![Project Demo](demo.gif) <!-- Replace with a link to your project demo or a GIF showcasing it --> 

## Overview

This project showcases a distributed key-value store implementation in Golang. The key-value store allows clients to store, retrieve, and delete key-value pairs in a distributed environment, highlighting proficiency in Golang and distributed systems concepts.

## Features

- **Distributed Architecture:** The project utilizes a distributed architecture to ensure scalability and fault tolerance in the key-value store.

- **Consistent Hashing:** Consistent hashing is employed to distribute data across nodes uniformly, preventing hotspots and ensuring efficient data retrieval.

- **Data Replication:** Key-value pairs are replicated across multiple nodes to enhance data availability and reliability.

- **CRUD Operations:** The key-value store supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through an intuitive API.

- **Concurrency Management:** Concurrency control mechanisms are implemented to handle concurrent read and write requests seamlessly.

- **Failure Handling:** The system gracefully handles node failures, reallocating data and maintaining data integrity.

## Technologies and Concepts Applied

- Golang programming language
- Distributed systems principles
- Networking libraries (e.g., `net` package)
- Consistent hashing algorithm
- Data replication strategies
- Concurrency control mechanisms

## Folder Structure

- `client`: Contains the client application for interacting with the distributed key-value store.
- `node`: Holds the code for the individual nodes in the distributed system.
- `store`: Includes the implementation of the distributed key-value storage logic.
- `utils`: Houses utility functions and shared components used across the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Follow the setup instructions in the respective subfolders (`client`, `node`, `store`) to configure and run the components.

## Usage

1. Start the nodes: Navigate to the `node` folder and run `go run node.go --port <port_number>` for each node.
2. Interact with the key-value store using the client application located in the `client` folder. Run the client with `go run client.go --server <server_address>`.

## Example

Here's a code snippet demonstrating how to interact with the key-value store from your client application:

```go
// Import the necessary packages
import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/your-username/your-repo/client"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize the client
    client := client.NewClient("server-address:port")

    // Perform operations
    key := "example_key"
    value := "example_value"
    
    // Store a value
    err := client.Store(key, value)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error storing value:", err)
    }
    
    // Retrieve a value
    retrievedValue, err := client.Get(key)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error retrieving value:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Retrieved value:", retrievedValue)
    }
    
    // Perform other operations...
}
```
