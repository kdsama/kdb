A go file inside orchestrator that will add container on input and remove them as well 
Better if this is a cli. 
It should not be a cli It should be running at all times ? 
For our version we can just make it connect to the main server, or the leader ? 
package orchestrator




// so this orchestration is difficult
// I need to add new containers 
// I need to give them each a new volume location, probably in the same directory itself
// I think I need to remove docker-compose 
// add docker run instead of compose 
// whatever random name is being given to be stored at a different location 
// I will add a folder inside of data and It will act like the data folder itself 
// lets test this on docker-compose test file first
